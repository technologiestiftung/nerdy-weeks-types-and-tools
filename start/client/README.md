# The Client


Scaffolded by running

```bash
npx create-react-app ./ --template typescript
```

And removed some unused files.


- Start with `npm start`
- For calls we need a [proxy setting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/)

> To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a proxy field to your package.json, for example:
      ```json
      "proxy": "http://localhost:4000",
      ```
